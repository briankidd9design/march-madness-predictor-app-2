                <h2>Love for the Game</h2>
                <p>
                  Since I started playing competively in the third grade, I knew
                  that basketball was the one sport that I completely connected
                  with. It was the only sport that I felt I was really good at
                  and also enjoyed. Now I am much older, and only play the
                  occasional pickup game at the gym or playground. However, like
                  most hoop fans, young and old, I still enjoy watching the game
                  and living vicariously through the amazing athletes at the
                  college and pro levels.
                </p>

                <h2>About this Site</h2>

                <p>
                  To use this site you must choose two teams from the data page
                  and in most cases, spell the team name exactly as it appears
                  in the data table. In some cases, abbreviations, team
                  initials, and spelling variations are accepted. For instance,
                  Washington State can also be entered as WSU.
                  <br /><br />
                  Once you choose two teams, enter each team into the input
                  fields of the calculation you wish to execute. Your
                  calculation options are Score Prediction Result and Statistics
                  Comparison. Then click the Calculate Button and the program
                  will return your results.
                  <br /><br />
                  The idea for this site came to me when I was filling out my
                  2023 NCAA Men's Division I Tournament Bracket. I was analyzing
                  the KenPom data and thought it would be useful to somehow have
                  a convenient way to compare the statistics between each team.
                  <br /><br />
                  As any serious tournament fan knows, there has never been a
                  recorded perfect bracket, and there is definitely not an exact
                  science to pick the winners of each game. Upsets happen
                  frequenlty in the Tournament, and besides stats, other factors
                  like injuries, player and personnel issues, travel time,
                  homecourt advantage and so on and so on...can have a profound
                  effect on the outcome of each game.
                  <br /><br />
                  My hope is that this site gives you the confidence to fill out
                  your bracket as an informed fan who has done their research.
                  If you have any feedback and/or suggestions, please visit the
                  feedback page and drop me a line. Thanks for visiting. --Brian
